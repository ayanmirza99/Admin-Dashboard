# Admission Dashboard

This is an Admission Dashboard built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [ShadCN UI](https://shadcn.dev/). This project is currently using dummy data due to the lack of API endpoints.

## Features

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first CSS styling.
- **ShadCN UI** for beautifully designed UI components.
- Responsive design, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Dark mode support.
